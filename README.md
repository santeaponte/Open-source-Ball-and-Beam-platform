# Open-source-Ball-and-Beam-platform


This repository contains all the resources needed to build and control a low-cost, open-source **Ball and Beam** experimental system for control education and research.

## üß† About the Project

The **Ball and Beam** system is a classic benchmark in control engineering due to its unstable and nonlinear dynamics. It allows the implementation of various control strategies, from basic PID to state feedback and modern model-based control.

Unlike most online examples that use commercial servo motors (which encapsulate the control logic internally), this project uses a standard **DC motor** driven by a **linear power stage**, offering complete control over the actuation and feedback loop.

The main goal is to provide a replicable and documented platform that enables hands-on learning in automatic control.
